These files contain the adjacency matrices of pairs of graphs that are known to
be fractionally isomorphic. The files `graph1.txt` and `graph2.txt` contain a
pair of graphs that are fractionally isomorphic but not isomorphic. The files
`graph3.txt` and `graph4.txt` contain a pair of graphs that are both isomorphic
and fractionally isomorphic. The file `graph5.txt` is fractionally isomorphic
to neither `graph3.txt` nor `graph4.txt`.
